## About

JobTracker was started in September 2022 as a way to not only aid myself in my current job search, (I was tracking all of my job applications in a notepad document that was ugly and incomprehensible), but also to help fill my resume out with a full stack MERN application. This has really been the first time I've really 'taken the training wheels off' and built something without any help or direction at this scale, and it has been an amazing learning experience. I spent a lot of time researching things like project architecture, the build process using webpack and gulp, and navigating the AWS eco-system. I used SASS in this project and I don't think I'll ever be going back to plain CSS. JobTracker uses Auth0 for its authentication and makes use of cloudinary to upload PDF and images.

## What's Next?

I plan to maintain JobTracker and fix any bugs that arise or any new features I think up. Hopefully it gets some users but even if not this I feel making this project has been a formative experience for me as a developer. My next goal is to migrate this project to Typescript/nextjs as well as write unit tests for the entire project.
